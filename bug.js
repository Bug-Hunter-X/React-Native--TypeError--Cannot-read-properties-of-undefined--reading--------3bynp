This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's common when fetching data asynchronously and trying to render it before it's loaded.  For instance, if you're fetching user data and trying to display the user's name before the fetch completes, you'll get this error if the fetch fails or is still pending. 

```javascript
//Incorrect
const UserComponent = ({ user }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text> 
    </View>
  );
};
```

This will throw a TypeError if `user` is null or undefined because you cannot access the `name` property of a null or undefined object.
